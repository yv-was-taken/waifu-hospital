# To Do


## Top Priority (needed for launch)
- [] stripe payment integration 
- [] refactor login/signup to be through firebase (connect with google account etc instead of handling manual email/username/password infra)
- [] merchandise mockup improvements (preset image for each item)
- [] merchandise character marketplace creation
    - needs to be on queue due to printful api rate limits for mockup generation, can take up to a few hours with even moderate traffic
- [] make website logo
- [] security protections site-wide
    - captcha on sign up/character creation
    - rate limiting
- [] paywalling image generation on character creation
- [] paywalling conversation limits 

## Secondary Priority (nice to have, can be rolled out over time)
- [] character caption implementation (mainly for merchandise addition)
- [] make conversations more intimate (prompt engineering)
- [] have characters remember chat history for users
- [] social media post creation automation/tooling implementation
    - video shorts
    - text/image post content
- [] character profile attribute personalization
    - outfit
    - accessories (necklace, piercings, tattoos, etc)
    - profile pose 
- [] character multiple pose images on character creation
    - good for merchandise, and "mood" changes during conversation
